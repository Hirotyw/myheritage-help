Contacting My Heritage.® USA™️ by Phone
Locating the Official Customer Service Number

Calling Best Practices
When you call:

Have your account details, order or test number, and personal contact info ready

Call during off‑peak hours—early weekday mornings often have shorter hold times

Use the prompts (voice menus) to select the service category that most closely matches your need

Identify yourself clearly and provide concise context

What to Expect During a Call
Verification questions to confirm your identity

A service ticket or confirmation ID—note this for later follow‑up

Resolution during the call or an estimated timeframe for updates

Using the Live Chat Feature
Why Live Chat Is Handy
Live chat combines immediacy with convenience:

No wait on hold music

Ability to share screenshots

Written transcript for reference

Chat Tips
Start with a clear question or brief issue summary

Include relevant visuals if possible

Ask directly for next‑level support if needed

Save or screenshot the chat for documentation

Sending an Email Inquiry
Choosing the Right Email Address
Find the official customer support email from your account dashboard, confirmation email, or the help center.

Crafting Your Message
Use a clear subject line: e.g. “Issue With Uploaded Document — Account: [your email]”

State your issue upfront in the first paragraph

Include detailed context, dates, numbers, attachments

State your desired outcome: refund, information, technical fix

Using the Customer Support Portal
If you have an account, the portal offers secure messaging:

Log in and locate “Help” or “Support” section

Send a secure message—attach files directly

Benefit: all records are tied to your account and encrypted

Social Media Channels: Proceed with Caution
You can reach out via platforms like Twitter or Facebook:

Use social media for general inquiries

Keep personal info private; they’ll likely ask to move to DM

Good for status updates and public announcements

Best Time To Make Contact
Weekdays typically offer quicker replies than weekends

Mid‑morning or early afternoon often see lower traffic

Log response times and call back during quieter hours

Preparing Before You Reach Out
Gather:

Account email, ID, and order/test numbers

Recent communication records (emails, chat transcripts)

Device info (browser, app version, OS)

Screenshots or error copies

This levels up your credibility and efficiency.

If You Can’t Reach Support
Switch from phone to chat, email, or portal

Post a general, polite note on social media to prompt contact

Visit a local testing partner or authorized reshipper, if available

Send a letter or escalation via postal mail for unresolved issues

Escalation Protocols
If first‑level support isn’t sufficient:

Ask to speak with a supervisor or specialist

Provide your service ticket/reference number and explain clearly

Follow their complaint escalation policy or internal review

If necessary, escalate externally (e.g., credit card dispute, Better Business Bureau)

Keeping Detailed Records
Maintain a communication log:

Date, time, and channel of contact

Name or ID of the representative

Summary of what was said and any agreed action

Follow‑up confirmations or reference numbers

This helps you follow up effectively and remain organized.

Security and Privacy Guidelines
When contacting support:

Avoid posting private data publicly

Verify any support line with official documentation

Check identity via secure login or designated authentication

Monitor your email or account for follow‑up notices

Top Self‑Service Tools You Can Try First
To potentially reduce the need to contact support:

FAQs in the Help Center

YouTube or video walkthroughs

Community forums with similar user issues

In‑site guides for uploading or tree navigation

Handling Urgent or Sensitive Issues
If you suspect unauthorized access or identity compromise:

Attach an urgent alert to calls or messages

Use fraud‑specific support lines

Freeze any questionable activity, orders, or shipments

Request written confirmation of emergency actions taken

International Support When in the USA
If you're outside the USA but contacting the U.S. team:

Use U.S. toll‑free or international line with correct dialing code

Confirm costs for international calling

Prefer chat or email if overseas charges loom

After Your Issue Is Resolved
Confirm completion and satisfaction with the resolution

Ask for any follow‑up email or written summary

Submit feedback or rating if offered
